Pupil Analysis
==============================

Pupilometry using OpenCV to extract salient features, namely pupil diameter over time. This repository comes with a .yml file that can be used with conda to build a virtual environment in which all code will function. The virtual environments uses python2.7

Most important functions can currently be found in:
    
    src/fix/

First, download anaconda to your computer. With conda loaded or in your path, navigate to the head of the repository and run this code from the command line:
    
    conda env create -f .env/pupil27.yml
    
This will create the proper environment in the folder you have specified previously with conda. Activate the environment with:
    
    conda activate pupil27

Using the interpreter in this environmen, the use of jupyter notebooks is available and all code will run smoothly. To verify the environment was installed correctly you can use:

    conda env list

or

    conda info --envs


The structural organization of the project is based on the Cookiecutter Data Science package. More information can be found here:
